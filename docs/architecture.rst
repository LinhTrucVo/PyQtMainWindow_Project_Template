Architecture
===========

This section provides a detailed overview of the PyQtMainWindow Project Template architecture.

System Overview
-------------

The PyQtMainWindow Project Template is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and provides a robust foundation for building multi-threaded Qt applications.

Component Architecture
--------------------

The system is composed of several key components that work together to provide window management and thread synchronization:

Thread Management
--------------

The system uses a sophisticated thread management system to handle window creation and communication:

Key Components
------------

1. **Window Management**
   - `Bico_QWindowThread`: Manages window threads and their lifecycle
   - `Bico_QWindowThread_UI`: Handles UI thread management
   - Thread-safe window creation and destruction

2. **Thread Communication**
   - `Bico_QMutexQueue`: Thread-safe message queue
   - `Bico_QMessData`: Message data structure
   - Synchronized communication between threads

3. **Core Framework**
   - `Bico_QThread`: Base thread implementation
   - Qt integration and event handling
   - Resource management and cleanup

Design Patterns
-------------

The system implements several design patterns:

1. **Thread Pool Pattern**
   - Efficient thread management
   - Resource reuse
   - Controlled concurrency

2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-driven communication
   - Loose coupling between components
   - Asynchronous updates

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Window creation
   - Thread instantiation
   - Resource management

4. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Application instance management
   - Thread registry
   - Global state management

Thread Safety
-----------

The system ensures thread safety through:

1. **Mutex Protection**
   - Queue operations
   - Resource access
   - State management

2. **Message Queue**
   - Thread communication
   - Event handling
   - State synchronization

3. **Resource Management**
   - Proper cleanup
   - Memory management
   - Thread termination

Best Practices
------------

1. **Window Creation**
   - Use the provided factory methods
   - Handle thread lifecycle
   - Manage resources properly

2. **Thread Communication**
   - Use message queues
   - Avoid direct state access
   - Handle synchronization

3. **Resource Management**
   - Clean up resources
   - Handle exceptions
   - Monitor memory usage

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Handle thread termination
